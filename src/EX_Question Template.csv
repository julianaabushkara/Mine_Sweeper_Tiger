"According to Galin’s definition, how does Software Quality Assurance (SQA) ensure a fault-free software product, and what are the primary causes that threaten this assurance?",expert,"SQA ensures confidence that the software process meets technical and managerial requirements by applying systematic, planned actions; however, this assurance is threatened by factors such as faulty requirement definitions, communication errors, and deviations from specifications",SQA guarantees a completely error-free software product by focusing only on post-release testing and customer feedback,SQA primarily ensures faster delivery by reducing the number of documentation steps in the development process,SQA is designed to replace developers’ manual testing with automated deployment tools to improve productivity,"SQA ensures confidence that the software process meets technical and managerial requirements by applying systematic, planned actions; however, this assurance is threatened by factors such as faulty requirement definitions, communication errors, and deviations from specifications",george
What can a software requirement represent?,easy,t can range from a high-level abstract statement of a service to a detailed mathematical functional specification,It only refers to the graphical design of the software interface.,It is a programming language used for software implementation.,It describes only the testing procedures of the system,t can range from a high-level abstract statement of a service to a detailed mathematical functional specification,claudia
What is the main difference between user requirements and system requirements?,medium,"User requirements describe the system’s services and constraints in natural language for customers, while system requirements provide detailed, structured technical specifications for engineers and developers","User requirements are written by developers, while system requirements are written by marketing teams","User requirements define software testing procedures, while system requirements describe customer feedback","User requirements focus only on interface design, while system requirements deal exclusively with financial budgeting","User requirements describe the system’s services and constraints in natural language for customers, while system requirements provide detailed, structured technical specifications for engineers and developers",deema
what major problem can arise when functional requirements are not precisely stated?,hard,"Ambiguous requirements may be interpreted in different ways by developers and users, leading to mismatched system behavior",Functional requirements will automatically become non-functional requirements,Users will lose access to the system’s data permanently,Developers will be forced to rewrite the system in another programming language,"Ambiguous requirements may be interpreted in different ways by developers and users, leading to mismatched system behavior",demitre
how can non-functional requirements influence system design and what challenge do they often present?,expert,"They can affect the overall system architecture rather than individual components, and are often difficult to state precisely or verify objectively","They only define user interface colors and layout, which are easy to measure and verify.",They focus solely on hardware specifications and rarely impact software architecture,They are always clearly defined and easy to test using automated scripts,"They can affect the overall system architecture rather than individual components, and are often difficult to state precisely or verify objectively",george
what is one main problem with using natural language to write requirements?,easy,Lack of clarity precision is difficult without making the document hard to read,It always ensures complete accuracy and understanding between developers,It prevents any confusion between functional and non-functional requirements,It guarantees that all requirements are expressed separately and clearly,Lack of clarity precision is difficult without making the document hard to read,claudia
what is the main purpose of ethnographic studies in software engineering?,medium,"To observe and analyze how people actually work, helping derive requirements based on real activities and cooperation rather than theoretical process definitions.",To test software performance and measure processing speed.,To design new system features that have not yet been implemented.,To replace interviews and documentation entirely in the requirement process.,"To observe and analyze how people actually work, helping derive requirements based on real activities and cooperation rather than theoretical process definitions.",deema
what is the relationship between SQA components and the project life cycle stages?,hard,SQA components are integrated throughout the project life cycle to prevent and detect errors during development and to manage faults during operation and maintenance.,SQA components are applied only after the project is completed to evaluate overall performance.,SQA activities are limited to the design phase and do not continue into maintenance.,SQA focuses solely on documenting requirements without influencing later project stages.,SQA components are integrated throughout the project life cycle to prevent and detect errors during development and to manage faults during operation and maintenance.,demitre
